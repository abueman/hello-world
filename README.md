Learn how to use GitHub.
This is a little bit about myself: I suffer from bipolar syndrome and that is why I am unemployed for over 3 years now.
It has been 5 years now since I have been an official developer. But I have made progress! I worked at Apple nearby at their Laguna Blvd. facility inspecting iPhones for a year and a half. So this means I CAN hold down a fulltime job for a good length of time. I am not working there currently because they require you to take a 3 month leave since I am a temp. In a couple weeks I will be able to return after taking 3 months off.
I would really like to get back into development but I am not sure how. I think somehow GitHub is the key. I need to either start my own project or contribute to someone elses project to get back on my developer feet again.
